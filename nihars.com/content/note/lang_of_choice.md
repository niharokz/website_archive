Over the last decade, I have gone through C, Python, Rust, Haskell, Go, Nim, and many others. Different languages have different use-cases. Some may prefer Python for its enormous libraries, some will go with Java for enterprise usages, some may love old school C for its hardware support, some may use Haskell for functional programming.

But the axiom of programming is to solve problems. The motto should be to solve the problem fast and efficiently. Nowadays, developers are becoming more and more language centric. Instead of sticking to one programming language, use THAT language that is efficient for THAT problem.

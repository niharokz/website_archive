Hope I knew git earlier. Source code of all the above project were lost when hosting expired. Learnt a lesson: 'Always keep backup'.   
Source code of nihars.in (2012-2016) and nihars.com (2016-2020) is archived in [this repository](https://github.com/niharokz/website_archive).

There are a few more websites I have worked on. Mostly these are Blogspot / similar platforms.

In today's world of bloated software, UNIX philosophy still stands strong. As hardware is becoming more capable and acceptable, developers are getting more freedom to add whatever features/bloat they want. As a result, modern-day software is becoming more and more bloated.  
               
In the 1980s and 1990s, hardware was limited. A developer had to think before implementing new codes to the software. These restrictions made those generation developers what we know today. Games like dangerous dave were just 0.21 MB.  Floppy disk was maximum portable storage. Software used to be efficient in terms of memory usage. C was the language of choice. Even after 40 years, C is still the best language when communicating with system hardware. 
               
The code should be minimal so that everyone can understand what it is doing. It should do one thing and do it well.

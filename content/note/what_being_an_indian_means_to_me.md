> *“A nation’s culture resides in the hearts and the soul of its people.” ~ Mahatma Gandhi*

The world is evolving rapidly. Modern-day society is starkly different from the past. But still, the quote from Mahatma Gandhi stands true. India is a land of culture and diversity. We Indians believe in brotherhood and respect each individual's opinion and choice. India is the mixture of the culture, customs, tradition, diversity of hearts, and the soul of its people. It is a nation where the youth loves the country and is driven towards enhancing its condition socially and economically would unquestionably become more beneficial.           
    
When one pronounces the word "India", one is absorbed in the smell in spices, clothes, the smell of pickles and rainfall, the compelling music and dances, the cheerful faces of youthful people. India encapsulates all of those emotions and more. India thrives on respect, languages, faith, and culture due to the diverse race of people living in the country.        
     
There is so much to be an Indian that one can never be proud enough. In today’s world of self-worship, we in India still respect our elders, care for our mates, and traditional culture. The pledge "All Indians are Brothers and Sisters" is believed and obeyed by all of us. Thus, I am proud to be an Indian because I am aware that it is a great opportunity and a tremendous responsibility too. I gratified to be an Indian because I know what I represent to society.           
    
Being an Indian, it is our sole obligation to protect its vast culture, customs, tradition, diversity, languages, foods, festivals, literature, civilisation, history, and many more. The list of our uniqueness is not limited. As a proud Indian citizen, we must uphold our uniqueness in every part of the world. India is one of the oldest civilisations still, our uniqueness is the same. Credits go to our ancestors for advancing our nation. Now it is our commitment to take it forward and make it the utopia of the world.           
    
The word Indian means so much to us. It is a never-ending emotion. The word is a powerful word that gives us the opportunity, responsibility, courage, pride, and prospect. So many have martyred to safeguard the word. The word unites a nation of 1.3 billion souls. Every person is supplementing some value to the word in whatever way they can. As an Indian, I promise to improve the country in whatever way achievable. Once upon a time, India was called the golden bird. Now it is our responsibility to make India the golden bird once again! Vande Mataram!

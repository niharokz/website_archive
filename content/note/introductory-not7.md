Hello! I am glad that you visited my Note. I assumed that I will not get any traffic in my Note. But you are here, making my assumption wrong.

Writing the first post for Note is often a struggle, isn't ? After spending a lot of time thinking and googling, I concluded that there is no perfect way to start a Note. But writing a simple and tl;dr introduction can do my work. So, here it is :

I created this space to write about technology, web development, reviews, and many other topics. My personal goal to start this Note is to improve my writing skills.

Finally, I wanted to say thanks to everyone who visited my website and spent time to read it. Grateful to every single person who viewed it. Any suggestions are always welcomed.

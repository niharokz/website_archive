<p>Hello everyone! I am a Systems programmer from India. I work at Edgeverve where we build modern banking applications. This website is my online garden - an abridgment of the stuff I've learned and created over the years. I also write about amazing technology, ideas that matter, writing clean code, open-source source codes.</p>
